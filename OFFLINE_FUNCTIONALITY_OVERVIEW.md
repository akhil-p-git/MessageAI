# Offline Functionality Overview

## ✅ Yes, You Have Comprehensive Offline Support!

Your MessageAI app includes a robust offline-first architecture that allows users to send and receive messages even without an internet connection.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. **NetworkMonitor.swift** - Real-Time Connectivity Tracking
**Location**: `MessageAI/Services/NetworkMonitor.swift`

**What it does:**
- Monitors network connectivity in real-time using Apple's Network framework
- Detects connection type (Wi-Fi, Cellular, Ethernet)
- Publishes connection status changes to the entire app
- Automatically logs connection/disconnection events

**Key Features:**
```swift
@Published var isConnected: Bool        // Real-time connection status
@Published var connectionType: ConnectionType  // Wi-Fi, Cellular, etc.
var connectionDescription: String       // Human-readable status
```

**How it works:**
- Uses `NWPathMonitor` to listen for network path changes
- Updates UI immediately when connection status changes
- Singleton pattern (`NetworkMonitor.shared`) for app-wide access

---

### 2. **MessageSyncService.swift** - Offline Queue & Sync Manager
**Location**: `MessageAI/Services/MessageSyncService.swift`

**What it does:**
- Manages a queue of messages that need to be sent
- Automatically syncs pending messages when connection is restored
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Tracks sync status and pending message count

**Key Features:**
```swift
@Published var isSyncing: Bool              // Currently syncing?
@Published var pendingMessageCount: Int     // How many messages queued?
```

**Sync Strategy:**
1. **Offline**: Messages are saved locally to SwiftData with `pending` status
2. **Connection Restored**: Automatically triggers `syncPendingMessages()`
3. **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 retries with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
4. **Batch Sync**: Can sync multiple messages in a single Firestore batch

**Functions:**
- `queueMessage()` - Save message locally and attempt to send
- `syncPendingMessages()` - Upload all pending messages when online
- `retryFailedMessages()` - Retry messages that failed to send
- `batchSyncMessages()` - Efficient batch upload

---

### 3. **OfflineBanner.swift** - Visual Status Indicator
**Location**: `MessageAI/Views/Components/OfflineBanner.swift`

**What it does:**
- Displays a banner at the top of ChatView showing offline/syncing status
- Shows pending message count
- Provides visual feedback with icons and colors

**UI States:**
- 🔴 **Offline** (Orange): "Offline - Messages will sync when online"
- 🔵 **Syncing** (Blue): "Syncing messages..." with spinner
- ✅ **Online** (Hidden): Banner disappears when connected

**Visual Elements:**
- Wi-Fi slash icon when offline
- Circular arrows icon when syncing
- Progress spinner during sync
- Pending message count badge

---

### 4. **Message Model** - Offline Support Fields
**Location**: `MessageAI/Models/Message.swift`

**Offline-Related Properties:**
```swift
var syncAttempts: Int = 0          // How many times we've tried to send
var lastSyncAttempt: Date?         // When was the last attempt?
var needsSync: Bool = false        // Does this message need syncing?
```

**Message Status Enum:**
```swift
enum MessageStatus {
    case pending    // Queued for sending (offline)
    case sending    // Currently being sent
    case sent       // Successfully sent to Firestore
    case delivered  // Delivered to recipient
    case read       // Read by recipient
    case failed     // Failed to send after retries
}
```

**Status Indicators:**
- ⏰ **Pending**: Clock icon (orange) - Waiting for connection
- ↑ **Sending**: Arrow up circle (blue) - Currently uploading
- ✓ **Sent**: Single checkmark (gray) - Uploaded to server
- ✓✓ **Delivered**: Double checkmark (gray) - Received by recipient
- ✓✓ **Read**: Double checkmark (blue) - Read by recipient
- ⚠️ **Failed**: Exclamation mark (red) - Failed after retries

## 🔄 How Offline Messaging Works

### Sending a Message While Offline:

1. **User types and sends message**
   ```
   User taps send → Message created locally
   ```

2. **NetworkMonitor checks connection**
   ```
   if NetworkMonitor.shared.isConnected {
       // Send immediately
   } else {
       // Queue for later
   }
   ```

3. **Message saved to SwiftData**
   ```
   message.status = .pending
   message.needsSync = true
   modelContext.insert(message)
   modelContext.save()
   ```

4. **UI shows pending status**
   ```
   Orange clock icon appears next to message
   OfflineBanner shows: "Offline - Messages will sync when online"
   ```

5. **Connection restored**
   ```
   NetworkMonitor detects connection
   → MessageSyncService.syncPendingMessages() triggered
   → All pending messages uploaded to Firestore
   → Status updated to .sent
   → UI updates automatically
   ```

## 📱 Integration in ChatView

**Location**: `MessageAI/Views/ChatView.swift`

### Initialization:
```swift
@StateObject private var networkMonitor = NetworkMonitor.shared
@StateObject private var syncService = MessageSyncService.shared
```

### UI Display:
```swift
VStack(spacing: 0) {
    // Offline/Syncing Banner
    OfflineBanner()
        .padding(.horizontal)
        .padding(.top, 4)
    
    // Rest of chat UI...
}
```

### Message Sending:
```swift
let newMessage = Message(
    id: messageID,
    conversationID: conversation.id,
    senderID: currentUser.id,
    content: text,
    timestamp: Date(),
    status: .sending,
    type: .text,
    needsSync: true  // Mark for sync
)

// Save locally first (optimistic UI)
messages.append(newMessage)
modelContext.insert(newMessage)
try? modelContext.save()

// Then upload to Firestore
Task {
    await uploadMessage(newMessage)
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### SwiftData Integration:
- All messages stored locally in SwiftData
- Persistent across app restarts
- Queries for pending messages on app launch
- Automatic sync when app comes to foreground

### Firestore Sync Strategy:
- **Optimistic UI**: Show message immediately, sync in background
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple messages synced in single batch
- **Exponential Backoff**: Retry delays increase (2s → 4s → 8s)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Server timestamp used as source of truth

### Network Monitoring:
- Uses Apple's Network framework (not Reachability)
- Monitors actual network path, not just interface
- Detects VPN, proxy, and captive portal scenarios
- Low battery impact (efficient path monitoring)
