## Group Chat Best Practices

### Naming Groups

**Good names**:
- "Marketing Team 2025"
- "SF Office Happy Hour"
- "Project Phoenix Planning"

**Avoid**:
- Generic: "Group Chat"
- Unclear: "The Guys"
- Too long: "Super Important Discussion About..."

### Adding Participants

**When creating**:
- Add everyone who needs to see messages
- Can add more later
- Consider group size (10-20 is manageable)

**When to add mid-conversation**:
- New team member joins
- Need input from someone
- Including stakeholders

### Group Etiquette

1. **Stay on topic**: Use different groups for different purposes
2. **@Mention** (future): Get someone's attention specifically
3. **React, don't reply**: Save "Noted" messages with 👍 instead
4. **Summarize regularly**: Use AI to keep everyone aligned
5. **Respect off-hours**: Check presence before messaging urgently

---

## AI Feature Best Practices

### Getting Better Summaries

**Tips**:
1. **Clear communication**: AI summarizes what's actually said
2. **Stay on topic**: Mixed topics = harder to summarize
3. **Be explicit**: "Decision: We're launching Friday" vs vague agreement
4. **Use names**: "John will handle X" vs "someone will handle X"

### Getting Better Action Items

**Make tasks clear**:
- ✅ "Sarah, please review the PR by Friday"
- ❌ "Maybe we should look at that thing sometime"

**Mention assignees**:
- ✅ "John will deploy to staging"
- ❌ "It needs to be deployed" (no assignee)

**State deadlines**:
- ✅ "Due by EOD Thursday"
- ❌ "As soon as possible" (vague)

### Better Search Results

**Natural language queries**:
- ✅ "What did Sarah say about the deadline?"
- ❌ "sarah deadline" (keyword search works, but semantic is better)

**Be specific**:
- ✅ "When is the product launch date?"
- ❌ "When?" (too vague)

**Use context**:
- ✅ "Show me decisions about the budget"
- ❌ "Decisions" (too broad)
