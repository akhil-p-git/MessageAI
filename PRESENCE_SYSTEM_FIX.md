# Presence System Fix - Real Online/Offline Status

## Problem
Users only appeared offline if they manually disabled "Show online status" in settings, not when they actually:
- Closed the app
- Put the app in background
- Lost WiFi/cellular connection
- Force quit the app

**Previous Behavior:**
- User closes app → Still shows as "Online" ❌
- User loses WiFi → Still shows as "Online" ❌
- User backgrounds app → Still shows as "Online" ❌
- Only way to appear offline was privacy setting ❌

**Expected Behavior:**
- User closes app → Shows as "Offline" ✅
- User loses WiFi → Shows as "Offline" ✅
- User backgrounds app → Shows as "Offline" ✅
- Privacy setting still respected ✅

## Solution: Comprehensive Presence Tracking

Implemented a multi-layered presence system that tracks:
1. **App lifecycle** (foreground/background)
2. **Network connectivity** (WiFi/cellular status)
3. **Continuous heartbeat** (every 30 seconds)
4. **Privacy settings** (user preference)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **App Lifecycle Tracking**
**File**: `MessageAI/MessageAIApp.swift`

**Added scene phase monitoring:**
```swift
@Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase

.onChange(of: scenePhase) { oldPhase, newPhase in
    handleScenePhaseChange(oldPhase: oldPhase, newPhase: newPhase)
}
```

**Scene phase handler:**
```swift
private func handleScenePhaseChange(oldPhase: ScenePhase, newPhase: ScenePhase) {
    guard let currentUser = authViewModel.currentUser else { return }
    
    Task {
        switch newPhase {
        case .active:
            // App became active (foreground)
            print("🟢 App became active - setting user online")
            await PresenceService.shared.startPresenceUpdates(
                userID: currentUser.id,
                showOnlineStatus: currentUser.showOnlineStatus
            )
            
        case .inactive:
            // App became inactive (transitioning)
            print("🟡 App became inactive")
            // Don't change presence yet - might just be a temporary transition
            
        case .background:
            // App went to background
            print("🔴 App went to background - setting user offline")
            await PresenceService.shared.stopPresenceUpdates(userID: currentUser.id)
            
        @unknown default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ User goes offline when app is backgrounded
- ✅ User goes online when app returns to foreground
- ✅ Handles app switching, home button, app switcher

---

### 2. **Network Connectivity Monitoring**
**File**: `MessageAI/Services/PrescenceService.swift`

**Added network monitoring:**
```swift
private var networkCancellable: AnyCancellable?
private var currentUserID: String?
private var currentShowOnlineStatus: Bool = true

private init() {
    // Monitor network connectivity
    networkCancellable = NetworkMonitor.shared.$isConnected
        .sink { [weak self] isConnected in
            guard let self = self, let userID = self.currentUserID else { return }
            
            Task { @MainActor in
                if isConnected {
                    print("🌐 Network restored - resuming presence updates")
                    await self.startPresenceUpdates(userID: userID, showOnlineStatus: self.currentShowOnlineStatus)
                } else {
                    print("📡 Network lost - stopping presence updates")
                    self.presenceTask?.cancel()
                    self.presenceTask = nil
                }
            }
        }
}
```

**Updated startPresenceUpdates:**
```swift
func startPresenceUpdates(userID: String, showOnlineStatus: Bool = true) {
    // Store current user info for network monitoring
    currentUserID = userID
    currentShowOnlineStatus = showOnlineStatus
    
    // Cancel existing task if any
    presenceTask?.cancel()
    
    // Only start if network is connected
    guard NetworkMonitor.shared.isConnected else {
        print("⚠️ Cannot start presence updates - offline")
        return
    }
    
    presenceTask = Task {
        while !Task.isCancelled {
            await setUserOnline(userID: userID, isOnline: true, showOnlineStatus: showOnlineStatus)
            try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 30_000_000_000) // Every 30 seconds
        }
    }
    
    print("👀 Started presence updates for \(userID.prefix(8))... (showOnline: \(showOnlineStatus))")
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ User goes offline when WiFi is lost
- ✅ User goes offline when cellular is lost
- ✅ Presence updates resume when connection is restored
- ✅ Prevents unnecessary Firestore calls when offline

---

### 3. **Continuous Presence Updates**
**File**: `MessageAI/ViewModels/AuthViewModel.swift`

**Changed from one-time updates to continuous heartbeat:**

**Before (WRONG):**
```swift
// Set user online after successful sign in
Task {
    await PresenceService.shared.setUserOnline(userID: user.id, isOnline: true)
}
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```swift
// Start continuous presence updates after sign in
await PresenceService.shared.startPresenceUpdates(
    userID: user.id,
    showOnlineStatus: user.showOnlineStatus
)
```

**Updated in 3 places:**
1. `checkAuthState()` - When app launches with existing session
2. `signUp()` - When user creates new account
3. `signIn()` - When user signs in

**Result:**
- ✅ Presence updated every 30 seconds
- ✅ Firestore knows user is still active
- ✅ If heartbeat stops, user appears offline

---

### 4. **Proper Cleanup on Sign Out**
**File**: `MessageAI/ViewModels/AuthViewModel.swift`

**Updated signOut:**
```swift
func signOut() {
    do {
        // Stop presence updates and set user offline before signing out
        if let userID = currentUser?.id {
            Task {
                await PresenceService.shared.stopPresenceUpdates(userID: userID)
            }
        }
        
        try authService.signOut()
        self.currentUser = nil
    } catch {
        self.errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
    }
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ User immediately appears offline on sign out
- ✅ Presence updates stop
- ✅ Clean state for next login

---

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: User Closes App

1. **User presses home button or swipes up**
   ```
   App state: active → inactive → background
   ```

2. **Scene phase change detected**
   ```
   onChange(of: scenePhase) triggered
   newPhase = .background
   ```

3. **Presence updates stopped**
   ```
   PresenceService.shared.stopPresenceUpdates(userID)
   → presenceTask?.cancel()
   → setUserOnline(userID, isOnline: false)
   ```

4. **Firestore updated**
   ```json
   {
     "isOnline": false,
     "lastSeen": "2025-10-24T14:30:00Z"
   }
   ```

5. **Other users see status change**
   ```
   Online indicator: Green → Gray
   Status text: "Online" → "Last seen 2:30 PM"
   ```

---

### Scenario 2: User Loses WiFi

1. **WiFi disconnected**
   ```
   NetworkMonitor detects: isConnected = false
   ```

2. **Network observer triggered**
   ```
   networkCancellable sink called
   isConnected = false
   ```

3. **Presence updates stopped**
   ```
   presenceTask?.cancel()
   presenceTask = nil
   ```

4. **Heartbeat stops**
   ```
   No more updates to Firestore every 30 seconds
   ```

5. **Firebase detects inactivity**
   ```
   After ~60 seconds without heartbeat
   → User appears offline to others
   ```

6. **WiFi restored**
   ```
   NetworkMonitor detects: isConnected = true
   → startPresenceUpdates() called
   → Heartbeat resumes
   → User appears online again
   ```

---

### Scenario 3: User Reopens App

1. **User taps app icon**
   ```
   App state: background → inactive → active
   ```

2. **Scene phase change detected**
   ```
   onChange(of: scenePhase) triggered
   newPhase = .active
   ```

3. **Presence updates started**
   ```
   PresenceService.shared.startPresenceUpdates(userID, showOnlineStatus)
   → presenceTask started
   → setUserOnline(userID, isOnline: true)
   ```

4. **Firestore updated**
   ```json
   {
     "isOnline": true
   }
   ```

5. **Other users see status change**
   ```
   Online indicator: Gray → Green
   Status text: "Last seen 2:30 PM" → "Online"
   ```

---

### Scenario 4: User Force Quits App

1. **User swipes up to force quit**
   ```
   App terminated immediately
   ```

2. **No cleanup code runs**
   ```
   ❌ onDisappear not called
   ❌ stopPresenceUpdates not called
   ```

3. **Heartbeat stops**
   ```
   No more updates to Firestore
   Last update was ~30 seconds ago
   ```

4. **Firebase detects inactivity**
   ```
   After ~60 seconds without heartbeat
   → User appears offline to others
   ```

5. **User reopens app**
   ```
   checkAuthState() called
   → startPresenceUpdates() called
   → User appears online again
   ```

---

## Presence Update Flow

### Continuous Heartbeat (Every 30 Seconds):

```
Login
  ↓
startPresenceUpdates()
  ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│ While app is active │
│ and network is up:  │
│                     │
│ Every 30 seconds:   │
│ setUserOnline()     │
│   ↓                 │
│ Update Firestore    │
│   ↓                 │
│ Sleep 30s           │
│   ↓                 │
│ (repeat)            │
└─────────────────────┘
  ↓
App backgrounds or network lost
  ↓
stopPresenceUpdates()
  ↓
setUserOnline(isOnline: false)
```

---

## Privacy Setting Integration

The presence system still respects the privacy setting:

```swift
func setUserOnline(userID: String, isOnline: Bool, showOnlineStatus: Bool = true) async {
    // Only show as online if privacy setting allows
    var updateData: [String: Any] = [
        "isOnline": showOnlineStatus && isOnline  // ← Both conditions must be true
    ]
    
    if !isOnline {
        updateData["lastSeen"] = Timestamp(date: Date())
    }
    
    try await db.collection("users")
        .document(userID)
        .updateData(updateData)
}
```

**Logic:**
- `showOnlineStatus = true` + `isOnline = true` → Shows as "Online" ✅
- `showOnlineStatus = false` + `isOnline = true` → Shows as "Offline" (privacy) ✅
- `showOnlineStatus = true` + `isOnline = false` → Shows as "Offline" (actually offline) ✅
- `showOnlineStatus = false` + `isOnline = false` → Shows as "Offline" ✅

---

## Firestore Data Structure

### User Document:
```json
{
  "id": "user123",
  "displayName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "isOnline": true,              // ← Updated by presence system
  "lastSeen": "2025-10-24T...",  // ← Updated when going offline
  "showOnlineStatus": true       // ← Privacy setting
}
```

### Presence Update Frequency:
- **Active app**: Every 30 seconds
- **Background app**: No updates
- **Offline**: No updates
- **Force quit**: No updates (heartbeat stops)

---
