# 🤖 AI Features - Testing Guide

## ✅ STATUS: DEPLOYED & FIXED

All 5 AI Firebase Functions are deployed and ready to test!

---

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST AI FEATURES

### **Prerequisites:**
1. ✅ Have at least 2 devices/simulators
2. ✅ Be signed in on both
3. ✅ Have a conversation with multiple messages
4. ✅ Messages should include:
   - Decisions ("Let's go with option A")
   - Action items ("Can you send the report?")
   - Questions that can be searched

---

## 📝 TESTING STEPS

### **1. Generate Test Data**

Send these messages in a test conversation:

```
User A: "Hey team, we need to decide on the database for the project"

User B: "I think we should go with Firebase. It's easy to set up."

User A: "Agreed! Can you handle the initial setup by Friday?"

User B: "Sure, I'll get it done. I'll also document the setup process."

User A: "Perfect! One more thing - can you review the UI mockups I sent?"

User B: "Will do! I'll send feedback by tomorrow."

User A: "Great. So to summarize: Firebase for backend, setup by Friday, and UI review by tomorrow."

User B: "Correct! Let me know if you need anything else."
```

---

### **2. Test AI Summary**

**Steps:**
1. Open the conversation
2. Tap the ✨ sparkles button (top right)
3. Tap "Summary" tab
4. Tap "Generate Summary"

**Expected Result:**
```
• Decided to use Firebase for the backend
• User B will handle Firebase setup by Friday
• User B will document the setup process
• User B will review UI mockups and provide feedback by tomorrow
```

**If it fails:**
- Check console for error messages
- Look for "📤 Calling summarizeThread"
- Look for "📥 Received response"
- Check if OpenAI key is valid

---

### **3. Test Action Items**

**Steps:**
1. In AI panel, tap "Action Items" tab
2. Tap "Extract Action Items"

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Handle Firebase setup
   Assignee: User B
   Deadline: Friday
   Priority: High

✅ Document setup process
   Assignee: User B
   Priority: Medium

✅ Review UI mockups
   Assignee: User B
   Deadline: Tomorrow
   Priority: High
```

---

### **4. Test Decision Tracking**

**Steps:**
1. In AI panel, tap "Decisions" tab
2. Tap "Track Decisions"

**Expected Result:**
```
Decision: Use Firebase for backend
Confidence: High
Participants: User A, User B
Context: Database selection for project
```

---

### **5. Test Smart Search**

**Steps:**
1. In AI panel, tap "Smart Search" tab
2. Enter query: "What did we decide about the database?"
3. Tap "Search"

**Expected Result:**
```
Found 2 relevant messages:

📍 "I think we should go with Firebase"
   Relevance: 95%
   Category: Discussion

📍 "Firebase for backend"
   Relevance: 98%
   Category: Decision

Summary: The team decided to use Firebase for the backend database.
```

## 🐛 DEBUGGING AI FEATURES

### **Console Logs to Check:**

Look for these in Xcode console:

**Success:**
```
🤖 AIService initialized
📤 Calling summarizeThread
ConversationID: [ID], MessageLimit: 100
ℹ️ Attempt 1 of 3
📥 Received response from summarizeThread
ℹ️ Response data: [summary points...]
✅ Successfully parsed summary with X points
```

**Errors:**
```
❌ Error in summarizeThread: [error message]
❌ Failed to parse summary from response
⚠️ Retrying in X seconds...
```

## 🔍 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### **Issue 1: "Must be authenticated"**
**Error:** `unauthenticated`  
**Fix:** Sign out and sign back in

### **Issue 2: "Function not found"**
**Error:** `functionNotFound`  
**Fix:** Deploy functions:
```bash
cd /path/to/MessageAI
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### **Issue 3: "Invalid response"**
**Error:** `parsingError`  
**Cause:** OpenAI returned unexpected format  
**Fix:** Check Firebase Function logs:
```bash
firebase functions:log
```

### **Issue 4: "Network error"**
**Error:** `networkError`  
**Fix:** 
- Check internet connection
- Try again (has 3 automatic retries)
- Check Firebase quota

### **Issue 5: "Permission denied"**
**Error:** `permissionDenied`  
**Fix:** Check Firestore security rules allow AI insights collection

---

## 🔬 ADVANCED DEBUGGING

### **Check Firebase Function Logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only summarizeThread
```

### **Check Firestore:**
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Go to Firestore
3. Check `conversations/{id}/messages` - ensure messages exist
4. Check `conversations/{id}/aiInsights` - AI results saved here

### **Test OpenAI Key:**
```bash
firebase functions:config:get openai.key
```

Should return a key starting with `sk-proj-...`

### **Manual Function Test:**
Use Firebase Console:
1. Go to Functions
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Look for recent invocations
4. Check for errors
