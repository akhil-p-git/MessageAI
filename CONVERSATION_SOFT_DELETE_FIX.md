# Conversation Soft Delete Fix

## Problem
Deleting a conversation was deleting it for **everyone**, not just the person who deleted it. This affected both 1-on-1 chats and group chats.

**Previous Behavior (WRONG):**
- User A deletes conversation ‚Üí Conversation disappears for User A **AND** User B
- User A deletes group chat ‚Üí Group disappears for **all members**
- Conversation was permanently deleted from Firestore

**Expected Behavior:**
- User A deletes conversation ‚Üí Only disappears for User A
- User B still sees the conversation
- If User B sends a new message ‚Üí Conversation reappears for User A

## Solution: Soft Delete with `deletedBy` Array

Implemented a "soft delete" system similar to how message deletion works, using a `deletedBy` array to track which users have deleted the conversation from their view.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Conversation Model
**File**: `MessageAI/Models/Conversation.swift`

**Added `deletedBy` field:**
```swift
var deletedBy: [String] = []  // Users who have deleted this conversation from their view
```

**Updated initialization:**
```swift
init(..., deletedBy: [String] = []) {
    // ...
    self.deletedBy = deletedBy
}
```

**Updated `toDictionary()`:**
```swift
func toDictionary() -> [String: Any] {
    var dict: [String: Any] = [
        // ...
        "deletedBy": deletedBy
    ]
    // ...
}
```

**Updated `fromDictionary()`:**
```swift
let deletedBy = data["deletedBy"] as? [String] ?? []

return Conversation(
    // ...
    deletedBy: deletedBy
)
```

---

### 2. Updated Delete Function (Soft Delete)
**File**: `MessageAI/Views/ConversationListView.swift`

**Changed from hard delete to soft delete:**

**Before (WRONG):**
```swift
// Delete the conversation document from Firestore
try await db.collection("conversations")
    .document(conversation.id)
    .delete()  // ‚ùå Deletes for everyone!
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```swift
// Add current user to deletedBy array (soft delete)
try await db.collection("conversations")
    .document(conversation.id)
    .updateData([
        "deletedBy": FieldValue.arrayUnion([currentUser.id])  // ‚úÖ Only hides for current user
    ])
```

**Key Changes:**
- Uses `updateData()` instead of `delete()`
- Adds current user's ID to `deletedBy` array
- Conversation document remains in Firestore
- Other users can still see it

---

### 3. Filter Deleted Conversations in Listener
**File**: `MessageAI/Views/ConversationListView.swift`

**Added filtering in `startListening()`:**

```swift
for document in snapshot.documents {
    var data = document.data()
    
    // Convert Firestore Timestamp to Date
    if let timestamp = data["lastMessageTime"] as? Timestamp {
        data["lastMessageTime"] = timestamp.dateValue()
    }
    
    if let conversation = Conversation.fromDictionary(data) {
        // Filter out conversations that the current user has deleted
        if conversation.deletedBy.contains(currentUser.id) {
            print("   üö´ Skipping conversation \(conversation.id.prefix(8))... (deleted by current user)")
            continue
        }
        
        newConversations.append(conversation)
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Result:**
- Conversations deleted by the current user don't appear in their list
- Other users still see the conversation normally

---

### 4. Conversation Reappears When New Message Sent
**File**: `MessageAI/Views/ChatView.swift`

**Added to all message sending functions** (`sendMessage`, `sendImageMessage`, `sendVoiceMessage`):

```swift
try await db.collection("conversations")
    .document(conversation.id)
    .setData([
        "id": conversation.id,
        "participantIDs": conversation.participantIDs,
        // ... other fields ...
        "deletedBy": FieldValue.arrayRemove([currentUser.id])  // Remove sender from deletedBy
    ], merge: true)
```

**Why this matters:**
- If User A deletes a conversation
- Then User B sends a new message
- User A's ID is removed from `deletedBy`
- Conversation reappears in User A's list
- User A gets notified of the new message

---

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: User Deletes Conversation

1. **User A swipes to delete conversation with User B**
   ```
   User A ‚Üí Swipe left ‚Üí Delete
   ```

2. **Firestore Update**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "conv123",
     "participantIDs": ["userA", "userB"],
     "deletedBy": ["userA"]  // ‚Üê User A added here
   }
   ```

3. **UI Update**
   - User A: Conversation disappears ‚úÖ
   - User B: Conversation still visible ‚úÖ

---

### Scenario 2: Deleted Conversation Reappears

1. **User A deletes conversation**
   ```json
   {
     "deletedBy": ["userA"]
   }
   ```

2. **User B sends a new message**
   ```
   User B ‚Üí Types "Hey!" ‚Üí Send
   ```

3. **Firestore Update**
   ```json
   {
     "deletedBy": [],  // ‚Üê User A removed!
     "lastMessage": "Hey!",
     "lastMessageTime": "2025-10-24T..."
   }
   ```

4. **UI Update**
   - User A: Conversation reappears with new message ‚úÖ
   - User A: Gets notification ‚úÖ
   - User B: Conversation always visible ‚úÖ

---

### Scenario 3: Group Chat Deletion

1. **User A deletes group chat**
   ```json
   {
     "participantIDs": ["userA", "userB", "userC"],
     "deletedBy": ["userA"]
   }
   ```

2. **Result**
   - User A: Group disappears ‚úÖ
   - User B: Group still visible ‚úÖ
   - User C: Group still visible ‚úÖ

3. **User B sends message**
   ```json
   {
     "deletedBy": []  // User A removed
   }
   ```

4. **Result**
   - User A: Group reappears ‚úÖ
   - All users: Can see the group ‚úÖ

---

## Benefits of Soft Delete

### ‚úÖ **Privacy & Control**
- Each user controls their own conversation list
- Deleting doesn't affect others
- Can "clean up" their inbox without consequences

### ‚úÖ **Message History Preserved**
- Conversation document remains in Firestore
- All messages still accessible if conversation reappears
- No data loss

### ‚úÖ **Automatic Reappearance**
- Conversation reappears when someone sends a new message
- User doesn't miss important messages
- Natural conversation flow

### ‚úÖ **Group Chat Friendly**
- Each member can delete independently
- Group doesn't disappear for everyone
- Members can rejoin by sending a message

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. **Both Users Delete Conversation**
```json
{
  "deletedBy": ["userA", "userB"]
}
```
- Conversation hidden for both
- Still exists in Firestore
- Reappears if either sends a message

### 2. **User Deletes Then Sends Message**
- User A deletes conversation
- User A opens ChatView (from history or link)
- User A sends message
- `deletedBy` removes User A
- Conversation reappears in User A's list

### 3. **All Group Members Delete**
```json
{
  "deletedBy": ["userA", "userB", "userC"]
}
```
- Hidden for everyone
- Still exists in Firestore
- Any member can revive by sending a message

## Testing Checklist

### 1-on-1 Chat:
- [ ] User A deletes conversation ‚Üí Only disappears for User A
- [ ] User B still sees conversation
- [ ] User B sends message ‚Üí Conversation reappears for User A
- [ ] User A gets notification of new message
- [ ] Both users delete ‚Üí Conversation hidden for both
- [ ] Either user sends message ‚Üí Reappears for both

### Group Chat:
- [ ] User A deletes group ‚Üí Only disappears for User A
- [ ] Other members still see group
- [ ] Any member sends message ‚Üí Group reappears for User A
- [ ] User A gets notification
- [ ] Multiple members delete independently ‚Üí Works correctly
- [ ] All members delete ‚Üí Group hidden for all
- [ ] Any member sends message ‚Üí Group reappears for all

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Delete conversation, force quit app, reopen ‚Üí Still deleted
- [ ] Delete conversation, other user sends message immediately ‚Üí Reappears
- [ ] Delete conversation, wait 1 hour, other user sends ‚Üí Reappears
- [ ] Delete conversation, navigate to chat from history ‚Üí Can send message
- [ ] Delete conversation, create new chat with same user ‚Üí New conversation or reappear?

## Database Impact

### Storage:
- ‚úÖ **Minimal**: Only adds one array field (`deletedBy`)
- ‚úÖ **Efficient**: Array only contains user IDs who deleted
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Array size = number of users who deleted (usually 0-2)

### Performance:
- ‚úÖ **Fast**: Client-side filtering is instant
- ‚úÖ **No Extra Queries**: Uses existing listener
- ‚úÖ **Indexed**: Can add index on `deletedBy` if needed

### Cleanup:
- üîÑ **Optional**: Could add Cloud Function to delete conversations where:
  - All participants have deleted it
  - No messages in last 30 days
  - This is optional and not implemented yet

## Comparison with Message Deletion

This implementation mirrors the message deletion system:

| Feature | Message Deletion | Conversation Deletion |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Tracking Field** | `deletedFor: [String]` | `deletedBy: [String]` |
| **Delete Action** | Add user to `deletedFor` | Add user to `deletedBy` |
| **Display Logic** | Filter messages by `deletedFor` | Filter conversations by `deletedBy` |
| **Reappear Logic** | N/A (messages don't reappear) | Remove user from `deletedBy` on new message |
| **Scope** | Per-message | Per-conversation |
