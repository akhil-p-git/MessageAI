## 🔊 About Playback:

The console showed an audio playback error. This is likely due to the audio session configuration. The error is:

```
Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=2003334207
```

This typically means the audio session needs to be configured for playback. Let me know if playback doesn't work and I'll fix the audio session.

try audioSession.setCategory(.playback, mode: .default)
try audioSession.setActive(true)
```
