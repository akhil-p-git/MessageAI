# ✅ Profile Picture Updates in Conversation List - FIXED!

## 🐛 THE PROBLEM

When someone updated their profile picture:
- ✅ It showed in Settings/Profile
- ❌ It didn't update in other users' conversation lists
- ❌ Old profile pictures were cached and never refreshed

---

## ✅ THE FIX

### **Change 1: Always Refresh User Data**

**Before:**
```swift
if userCache[participantID] == nil {
    // Only load if not in cache
}
```

**After:**
```swift
// Always refresh user data (not just if nil)
// This ensures profile picture updates are reflected
if let user = try? await AuthService.shared.fetchUserDocument(userId: participantID) {
    userCache[participantID] = user
}
```

### **Change 2: Refresh on View Appear**

Added to `.onAppear`:
```swift
.onAppear {
    startListening()
    startListeningForNewMessages()
    
    // Refresh user data to get latest profile pictures
    Task {
        await loadUserInfo()
    }
}
```

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS NOW

### **Scenario A: User Updates Profile Picture**
```
User A uploads new profile picture
    ↓
Saves to Firestore users collection
    ↓
User B opens conversation list
    ↓
.onAppear triggers loadUserInfo()
    ↓
Fetches latest user data from Firestore
    ↓
✅ New profile picture displays!
```

### **Scenario B: Real-Time Updates**
```
User B is viewing conversation list
    ↓
User A updates profile picture
    ↓
Next time conversation updates (message sent, etc.)
    ↓
loadUserInfo() is called again
    ↓
✅ Profile picture refreshes!
```

## 🔍 DEBUGGING

### **Issue: Profile picture still not updating**

**Check 1: Is it uploading?**
- Go to Firebase Console → Storage
- Look in `profile_pictures/` folder
- Should see: `profile_{userID}.jpg`

**Check 2: Is Firestore updated?**
- Go to Firebase Console → Firestore
- Open `users` collection → your user document
- Check `profilePictureURL` field
- Should have the new URL

**Check 3: Is cache refreshing?**
- Check console logs
- Look for user fetch logs from `AuthService`
