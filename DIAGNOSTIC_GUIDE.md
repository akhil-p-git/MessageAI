### Test 2: Create New Chat

**Steps:**
1. Tap "New Chat" (+ button in toolbar)
2. Enter an email address of another user
3. Tap "Start Chat"

**Expected Console Output:**
```
🔍 Finding or creating conversation...
   Current User: abc123...
   Other User: def456...
   Found 2 existing conversations
   📝 Creating new conversation...
   ✅ Created conversation: xyz789...
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- New conversation appears in list
- Can navigate to chat screen
- No blue dot (no messages yet)

---

### Test 3: Send Message

**Steps:**
1. Open a chat
2. Type a message
3. Tap send

**Expected Console Output:**
```
📤 SENDING MESSAGE
   From: John Doe (abc123...)
   To Conversation: xyz789...
   Message: Hello World
   ✅ Added to local UI

⌨️  Setting typing: false for John Doe in conversation xyz789...
   ✅ Removed John Doe from typing users

📤 Uploading to Firestore...
   Message ID: msg123...
   ✅ Message uploaded to Firestore
   ✅ Conversation metadata updated
   ✅ Local status updated to 'sent'
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Message appears immediately with clock/sending icon
- Icon changes to checkmark when sent
- Other user receives message in real-time

---

### Test 4: Typing Indicators

**Steps:**
1. Device A: Open a chat
2. Device A: Start typing
3. Device B: Should see "User is typing..."
4. Device A: Stop typing
5. After 3 seconds, typing indicator disappears on Device B

**Expected Console Output (Device A):**
```
⌨️  Setting typing: true for John Doe in conversation xyz789...
   ✅ Added John Doe to typing users

⌨️  Setting typing: false for John Doe in conversation xyz789...
   ✅ Removed John Doe from typing users
```

---

### Test 5: Read Receipts

**Steps:**
1. Device A: Send a message
2. Device B: Receive message (gray checkmark on Device A)
3. Device B: Open chat
4. Device A: Should see blue checkmark

**Expected Console Output (Device B):**
```
📖 MARKING 1 MESSAGES AS READ
   ✅ Batch committed: 1 messages marked as read
   ✅ Cleared unread indicator
   ✅ Local messages updated
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Single gray checkmark when sent
- Double gray checkmark when delivered
- Double blue checkmark when read

---

### Test 6: Unread Blue Dot

**Steps:**
1. Device B: Send message to Device A
2. Device A: See blue dot in conversation list
3. Device A: Open chat
4. Blue dot should disappear immediately

**What's Happening:**
- When message is sent, sender's ID is added to `unreadBy` array
- `ConversationRow` checks if current user is in `unreadBy`
- When chat is opened, `markMessagesAsRead()` removes user from `unreadBy`
- Blue dot disappears because user is no longer in the array

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "❌ Firebase Auth: NOT LOGGED IN"

**Solution:**
1. Sign out completely
2. Close app
3. Reopen app
4. Sign in again

---

### Issue: "❌ PERMISSION DENIED"

**Console shows:**
```
Error Code: 7
🔒 PERMISSION DENIED
```

**Solution:**
1. Check that Firestore rules were deployed:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```
2. Check Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules tab
3. Ensure rules allow authenticated users to read/write

---

### Issue: Messages not sending

**Check Console for:**
- "❌ Not authenticated" → Sign in again
- "❌ FIREBASE ERROR: ..." → Check error code
- "⚠️ Cannot send: empty message or no user" → User not loaded

**Quick Test:**
Open Xcode console and run:
```swift
DiagnosticHelper.testSendMessage(
    conversationID: "your-conversation-id",
    content: "Test message"
)
```

---

### Issue: Typing indicators not showing

**Possible Causes:**
1. Firestore rules blocking `typingUsers` field updates
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Listener not set up in ChatView

**Check:**
- Console for "⌨️ Setting typing..." messages
- Firebase Console → Firestore → Check conversation document for `typingUsers` field
- Network status in app

---

### Issue: Blue dot not disappearing

**Check:**
1. Is `markMessagesAsRead()` being called?
   - Look for "📖 MARKING X MESSAGES AS READ" in console
2. Is `unreadBy` being cleared?
   - Look for "✅ Cleared unread indicator"
3. Check Firebase Console:
   - Open conversation document
   - Look at `unreadBy` array
   - Should be empty after reading messages

---

## 📊 Firebase Console Checks

### Check 1: View Collections

1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Should see these collections:
   - `users`
   - `conversations`
   - `typing`
   - `presence`
   - `_diagnostics` (test data)

### Check 2: View Conversation Document

1. Click `conversations` collection
2. Select any conversation
3. Should see these fields:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "xyz789...",
     "isGroup": false,
     "participantIDs": ["user1", "user2"],
     "lastMessage": "Hello",
     "lastMessageTime": "2025-10-24 12:00:00",
     "lastSenderID": "user1",
     "lastMessageID": "msg123...",
     "unreadBy": ["user2"],
     "typingUsers": []
   }
   ```

### Check 3: View Message Document

1. Click a conversation
2. Click `messages` subcollection
3. Select any message
4. Should see:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "msg123...",
     "conversationID": "xyz789...",
     "senderID": "user1",
     "content": "Hello",
     "timestamp": "2025-10-24 12:00:00",
     "status": "sent",
     "type": "text",
     "readBy": ["user1"]
   }
   ```

## 🎯 Quick Diagnostic Commands

Add these to your code temporarily for testing:

### Test Firebase Write
```swift
Task {
    let db = Firestore.firestore()
    try await db.collection("_test").document("test").setData(["test": true])
    print("✅ Firebase write works!")
}
```

### Check Current User
```swift
if let user = Auth.auth().currentUser {
    print("✅ Logged in as: \(user.uid)")
} else {
    print("❌ Not logged in!")
}
```

### Test Message Send
```swift
DiagnosticHelper.testSendMessage(
    conversationID: conversation.id,
    content: "Test message"
)
```

---

## 📝 Next Steps

Once all tests pass:

1. **Remove DEBUG code** (if desired):
   - Remove `#if DEBUG` test blocks
   - Keep logging for production debugging

2. **Monitor Production**:
   - Check Firebase Console regularly
   - Monitor Crashlytics for errors
   - Check user reports

3. **Optimize**:
   - Add offline support (already started with NetworkMonitor)
   - Add message retry logic
   - Implement message queuing

4. **Security**:
   - Review Firestore rules before production
   - Add rate limiting
   - Validate all inputs

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

All these should work:
- ✅ Can create new chats
- ✅ Messages send and appear immediately
- ✅ Other user receives messages in real-time
- ✅ Typing indicators show when typing
- ✅ Read receipts show blue checkmarks
- ✅ Blue unread dots appear and disappear correctly
- ✅ No console errors during normal operation
- ✅ Diagnostics pass all tests

---

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If problems persist after all fixes:

1. **Run full diagnostics:**
   - Launch app and check console output
   - Copy diagnostic results

2. **Check Firebase Console:**
   - Firestore Database → Rules
   - Authentication → Users
   - Check for any error logs

3. **Clean build:**
   ```bash
   # In Xcode
   Product → Clean Build Folder (⌘⇧K)
   Product → Build (⌘B)
   ```

4. **Reset Firebase:**
   ```bash
   # Delete and re-download GoogleService-Info.plist
   # Restart Firebase in project
   ```
