---

## 📝 Files Modified/Created

### **1. NotificationManager.swift** (NEW) ✅
**Created comprehensive notification manager with:**
- Permission request handling
- Firebase Cloud Messaging integration
- Active chat tracking (`currentChatID`)
- Smart notification rules
- FCM token management
- Notification delegate methods

**Key Features:**
```swift
// Rule 1: Don't show if you sent it
guard senderID != currentUserID

// Rule 2: Don't show if you're in this chat
guard conversationID != currentChatID

// Show notification
showNotification(title: sender, body: message...)
```

---

### **2. MessageAIApp.swift** ✅
**Added:**
- `import UserNotifications`
- Notification delegate setup in `init()`
- `.task` modifier to call `NotificationManager.shared.setup()`

**Changes:**
```swift
init() {
    FirebaseApp.configure()
    verifyFirebaseConfiguration()
    
    // Set notification delegate
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = NotificationManager.shared
}

.task {
    await NotificationManager.shared.setup()
}
```

---

### **3. ChatView.swift** ✅
**Added:**
- `NotificationManager.shared.enterChat()` in `.onAppear`
- `NotificationManager.shared.exitChat()` in `.onDisappear`
- Notification trigger in message listener (case .added)

**Changes:**
```swift
.onAppear {
    // Track that we're viewing this chat
    NotificationManager.shared.enterChat(conversation.id)
    // ... rest of code
}

.onDisappear {
    // Track that we left this chat
    NotificationManager.shared.exitChat()
    // ... rest of code
}

// In message listener:
case .added:
    // ... save message ...
    
    // Trigger notification for messages from others
    if updatedMessage.senderID != currentUser.id {
        NotificationManager.shared.showNotification(
            title: senderName,
            body: message.content,
            conversationID: conversation.id,
            senderID: message.senderID,
            currentUserID: currentUser.id
        )
    }
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Notification Decision Flow:**

```
New message arrives
    ↓
Is sender == currentUser?
    YES → 🚫 Don't show (you sent it)
    NO  → Continue
    ↓
Is conversationID == currentChatID?
    YES → 🚫 Don't show (you're in this chat)
    NO  → Continue
    ↓
✅ Show notification banner
```

### **Chat Tracking:**

```
User opens ChatView with Person B
    ↓
NotificationManager.currentChatID = "person_b_chat_id"
    ↓
Message arrives from Person C
    ↓
Check: "person_c_chat_id" != "person_b_chat_id"
    ↓
✅ Show notification
```

2. Should see iOS notification permission dialog

**Expected:**
- ✅ Permission dialog appears
- Options: "Allow" / "Don't Allow"

**If Allow:**
```

**Steps:**
1. Tap notification banner

**Expected (when implemented):**
- Opens the conversation where message was sent

**Console Output:**
```

```

---

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### **Issue: No notifications show at all**

**Check 1: Permission granted?**
```
Look for in console:
✅ Notification permission granted

If NOT granted:
- Go to iOS Settings → MessageAI → Notifications
- Toggle "Allow Notifications" ON
```

**Check 2: Is NotificationManager setup called?**
```
Look for in console:
🔔 Setting up notifications...
✅ Notification setup complete
```

**Check 3: Are messages being received?**
```
Look for in console:
➕ Added message: '...' from ...
```

**Check 4: Is notification being triggered?**
```
Look for one of these:
🔔 Showing notification: ... - ...
🚫 Not showing notification: you sent this message
🚫 Not showing notification: you're in this chat
```

---

### **Issue: Notifications show when they shouldn't**

**Symptom: Notification shows when you send message**

**Check:**
```swift
// In showNotification():
guard senderID != currentUserID else {
    print("🚫 Not showing notification: you sent this message")
    return
}
```

**Debug:**
- Print `senderID` and `currentUserID`
- Should be different to show notification

---

**Symptom: Notification shows when you're in that chat**

**Check:**
```swift
guard conversationID != currentChatID else {
    print("🚫 Not showing notification: you're in this chat")
    return
}
```

**Debug:**
- Check if `enterChat()` is being called in `.onAppear`
- Check if `exitChat()` is being called in `.onDisappear`
- Print current chat tracking:
```
📍 Entered chat: abc123...
📍 Exited chat
```

---

### **Issue: Permission denied, can't re-request**

**iOS only asks for permission ONCE.**

**To re-enable:**
1. Close app
2. Go to iOS Settings
3. Scroll to MessageAI
4. Tap Notifications
5. Toggle "Allow Notifications" ON

**Or reset simulator:**
```bash
# Reset simulator permissions
xcrun simctl privacy booted reset all com.your.bundle.id
```

## 🚀 What's Working Now

✅ **In-App Notifications** - Banner shows when app is open  
✅ **Smart Rules** - Only shows when appropriate  
✅ **Chat Tracking** - Knows which chat you're in  
✅ **Permission Handling** - Requests notification access  
✅ **Firebase Integration** - FCM token management  
✅ **Real-Time** - Immediate notifications  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### **1. Notification Tap Navigation**
Currently logs which conversation was tapped. Could implement navigation:
```swift
// In NotificationManager
func userNotificationCenter(
    _ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
    didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse,
    withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void
) {
    let conversationID = userInfo["conversationID"] as? String
    // TODO: Navigate to this conversation
}
```

### **2. Remote Push Notifications**
For notifications when app is completely closed, need Firebase Cloud Functions:
- See the BONUS section in the implementation prompt
- Deploy function that triggers on new messages
- Sends FCM push to recipients

### **3. Notification Customization**
- Custom notification sounds
- Different sounds for different contacts
- Priority/urgent message indicators

### **4. Notification Grouping**
- Group messages by conversation
- Show message count per conversation
- Clear all notifications from one chat

---

## 📚 Technical Details

### **Permission Model:**
- **First Launch:** iOS shows permission dialog
- **Granted:** Notifications work normally
- **Denied:** No banners, must enable in Settings
- **Not Determined:** Will show dialog

### **Notification Lifecycle:**
```
1. App launches
2. Request permission (first time only)
3. Register for remote notifications
4. Receive FCM token
5. Save token to Firestore
6. Listen for messages
7. Show local notifications
8. Handle notification taps
```

### **Chat Tracking:**
```
currentChatID = nil  // Not in any chat

User opens ChatView("abc123")
currentChatID = "abc123"  // In chat abc123

User closes ChatView
currentChatID = nil  // Not in any chat

Message from "abc123" arrives
→ No notification (was just in that chat)

Message from "xyz789" arrives
→ Show notification ✅
```
