- ‚úÖ Text input for analyzing any message
- ‚úÖ Real-time analysis with loading states
- ‚úÖ Visual urgency score with progress bar
- ‚úÖ Displays AI reasoning for the priority level
- ‚úÖ Shows urgency indicators as tags
- ‚úÖ Responsive FlowLayout for tags
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 4. Integrated into AI Features Menu
**File:** `MessageAI/Views/AI/AIFeaturesView.swift`

## üß™ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Build and Run
```bash
# Build the project
‚åòB

# Run on simulator or device
‚åòR
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Priority Detection
1. Open any conversation
2. Tap the sparkles icon (‚ú®) in the navigation bar
3. Select the "Priority" tab (orange triangle icon)

### Step 3: Test Different Priority Levels

#### Test Case 1: HIGH PRIORITY
**Input:**
```
URGENT: Production server is down! Need immediate attention! 
Critical bug affecting all users. Please respond ASAP!
```

**Expected Output:**
- Priority: HIGH (red)
- Urgency Score: 85-100
- Reason: Mentions urgency keywords, critical issue
- Indicators: "URGENT", "ASAP", "Critical", "immediate"

#### Test Case 2: MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Input:**
```
Can you review the PR by end of week? It's blocking the next sprint.
Would appreciate your feedback when you have time.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Priority: MEDIUM (orange)
- Urgency Score: 40-70
- Reason: Has deadline but not immediate
- Indicators: "end of week", "blocking", "deadline"

#### Test Case 3: LOW PRIORITY
**Input:**
```
Hey! How was your weekend? Did you catch the game last night?
Let me know if you want to grab coffee sometime.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Priority: LOW (gray)
- Urgency Score: 0-30
- Reason: Casual conversation, no urgency
- Indicators: (empty or minimal)

### Step 4: Verify Console Logs

You should see detailed logs like:
```
üì§ AIService: Calling detectPriority
‚ÑπÔ∏è AIService: Message: URGENT: Production server is down! Need im...
‚ÑπÔ∏è AIService: Attempt 1 of 3
üì• AIService: Received response from detectPriority
‚ÑπÔ∏è AIService: Response data: ["priority": "high", "score": 95, ...]
‚úÖ AIService: Priority detected: high (score: 95.0)
```

## üé® UI FEATURES

### Priority Badge
- **High Priority:** Red background, triangle icon
- **Medium Priority:** Orange background, circle icon
- **Low Priority:** Gray background, dot icon

### Urgency Score
- Large, bold number (0-100)
- Color-coded progress bar
- Visual representation of urgency

### Analysis Section
- AI-generated reasoning
- Explains why the priority was assigned
- Clear, user-friendly language

### Urgency Indicators
- Keyword tags in flowing layout
- Color-coded by priority level
- Shows what triggered the urgency detection

---

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Backend Integration
- Uses Firebase Cloud Function: `detectPriority`
- Sends `messageText` and optional `conversationContext`
- Receives structured response with priority, score, reason, indicators

### Error Handling
- Automatic retry (up to 3 attempts)
- Exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation

### Performance
- Async/await for non-blocking UI
- Loading states during analysis
- Smooth animations for results
- Efficient layout with FlowLayout

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Network error"
**Solution:** Check Firebase connection, ensure Functions are deployed

### Issue: "Parsing error"
**Solution:** Verify backend response format matches expected structure

### Issue: No results appear
**Solution:** Check console logs, verify OpenAI API key is set in Functions

### Issue: Low scores for urgent messages
**Solution:** Backend may need tuning, check AI prompt in Functions

---

## üì± USER EXPERIENCE

### Flow
1. User opens AI features
2. Taps Priority tab
3. Enters or pastes message
4. Taps "Analyze Priority"
5. Loading spinner appears
6. Results animate in
7. User sees priority, score, reasoning, indicators

### Accessibility
- Large, readable text
- Color-coded with icons (not just color)
- Clear labels and descriptions
- VoiceOver compatible

---

## üöÄ FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### Possible Additions:
1. **Auto-detect on send:** Analyze priority when user sends message
2. **Priority badges in chat:** Show priority icon next to urgent messages
3. **Priority filtering:** Filter conversations by priority level
4. **Priority notifications:** Alert user for high-priority messages
5. **Batch analysis:** Analyze multiple messages at once
6. **Priority trends:** Show priority distribution over time
